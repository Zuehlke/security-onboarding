## AJAX ##

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with server-side scripts. 

It can send as well as receive information in a variety of formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and even text files. 

AJAXâ€™s most appealing characteristic, however, is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can do all of this without having to refresh the page. This lets you update portions of a page based upon user events.

    var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

	    xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
		    if (xhttp.readyState == 4 && xhttp.status == 200) {
		      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = xhttp.responseText;
		    }
	    }

    xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
    xhttp.send();

The open() parameters are:

1. method: the type of request: GET or POST
2. url
3. async: true (asynchronous) or false (synchronous)

jQuery example of AJAX:

    $.ajax({
	    url: 'getTwitterFollowers.php',
	    type: 'GET',
	    data: 'twitterUsername=jquery4u',
	    success: function(data) {
	    	//do something
	    },
	    error: function(e) {
	    	//do something else
	    }
    });
