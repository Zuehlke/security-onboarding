## Event bubbling and capturing ##

**Event bubbling** states that after an event triggers on the deepest possible element, it then triggers on parents in nesting order.

    <div class="d1">1  <!-- the topmost -->
	    <div class="d2">2
		    <div class="d3">3 <!-- the innermost -->
		    </div>
	    </div>
    </div>

The bubbling guarantees that click on Div 3 will trigger onclick first on the innermost element 3 (also caled the target), then on the element 2, and the last will be element 1.

The deepest element which triggered the event is called the target or, the originating element.

Internet Explorer has the **srcElement** property for it, all W3C-compliant browsers use **event.target**.

When event handlers trigger on parents:

1. **Event.target**/**srcElement** - remains the same originating element.
2. **This** - is the current element, the one event has bubbled to, the one which runs the handler.

A handler may decide that event is fully processed and stop the bubbling.

1. For W3C-compliant browsers: **event.stopPropagation()**
2. For IE<9: **event.cancelBubble = true**


In all browsers, except IE<9, there are two stages of event processing.


**The event first goes down - thatâ€™s called capturing, and then bubbles up**. This behavior is standartized in W3C specification.

**All methods of event handling ignore the capturing phase**. 

Using **addEventListener with last argument true is only the way to catch the event at capturing**.

    elem.addEventListener( type, handler, phase )

According to this model, the event:

1. Captures down - through 1 -> 2 -> 3.
2. Bubbles up - through 3 -> 2 -> 1.

The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element.

    //execute displayDate() on the click event
    document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", function() {
		console.log( "click" );
    });

The same in jQuery:

    $("#myBtn").on( "click", function() {
    	console.log( "click" );
    });
